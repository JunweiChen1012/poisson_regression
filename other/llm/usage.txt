This paper investigates the distribution of the letter 'n' in the early lines of each chapter of Frank Lewis Nason's novel 'Blue Goose', building upon historical linguistic analyses such as Edgeworth's study of dactyls in Virgil’s Aeneid. Utilizing the Gutenberg text of 'Blue Goose', we analyzed the first thirty lines of each chapter to count the occurrences of the letter 'n' (both uppercase and lowercase) and to tally the total word count. Our objective was to examine whether there is a correlation between the number of words and the frequency of 'n' in these sections, potentially reflecting upon linguistic or stylistic patterns. Employing a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution, we assessed the relationship between word count and letter frequency, adjusting for overdispersion. The preliminary results suggest that the distribution of 'n' does not uniformly increase with the number of words, indicating nuances in Nason's linguistic choices that merit further exploration. This study contributes to the broader field of digital humanities by demonstrating the potential of computational text analysis in literary studies and offers insights into the stylistic elements of early 20th-century American literature.

This paper explores the distribution of the letter 'n' in the opening lines of each chapter of Frank Lewis Nason's novel 'Blue Goose', extending historical linguistic research such as Edgeworth's analysis of dactyls in Virgil’s Aeneid. We utilized the Gutenberg text of 'Blue Goose', analyzing the first thirty lines of each chapter to count the occurrences of the letter 'n' (both uppercase and lowercase) and to calculate the total word count. The goal was to investigate if there is a relationship between the word count and the frequency of 'n' in these excerpts, which might reflect specific linguistic or stylistic patterns. Using a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution, we evaluated the correlation between word count and letter frequency, accounting for overdispersion. The initial findings indicate that the frequency of 'n' does not consistently increase with the word count, suggesting nuances in Nason's language use that warrant further investigation. This research enhances the broader discipline of digital humanities by showcasing the capabilities of computational text analysis in literary studies, and it provides insights into the stylistic features of early 20th-century American literature.

Introduction

The study of letter frequency in literary texts has a rich history, tracing back to pioneering works such as Edgeworth's analysis of dactyls in Virgil’s Aeneid [@edgeworth1885methods]. These investigations offer unique insights into the linguistic and stylistic choices of authors, revealing patterns that might otherwise remain obscured. In the digital age, the accessibility of literary works through projects like Gutenberg has opened new avenues for computational text analysis, allowing researchers to explore these patterns across larger datasets with increased precision.

"Blue Goose" by Frank Lewis Nason, a novel published in the early 20th century, presents a compelling case for such analysis. This work, reflective of its time, may embed linguistic patterns indicative of Nason's stylistic choices or the narrative's thematic concerns. Specifically, this study focuses on the distribution of the letter 'n', a common letter in the English language, within the first thirty lines of each chapter of the novel. The research question guiding this investigation is whether there is a significant relationship between the frequency of the letter 'n' and the word count in these sections of text, and if so, what this might reveal about Nason's writing style or the text's linguistic texture.

This paper builds upon the foundation laid by previous scholars, employing a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to analyze the relationship between word count and letter frequency. By doing so, it not only contributes to the field of digital humanities by applying quantitative methods to literary analysis but also provides insights into the stylistic elements that characterize Nason's "Blue Goose". Understanding these patterns can enhance our appreciation of Nason's work and offer a broader perspective on early 20th-century American literature.

In the following sections, we will outline the methodology employed in collecting and analyzing the data, present our findings, and discuss the implications of our study. Through this investigation, we aim to deepen our understanding of the linguistic dimensions of "Blue Goose", situating it within the broader context of literary stylistics and computational text analysis.

Introduction

The analysis of letter frequency in literary texts has a long and distinguished history, dating back to seminal efforts like Edgeworth's study of dactyls in Virgil's Aeneid (Edgeworth, 1885). Such research unveils the nuanced linguistic and stylistic choices of authors, uncovering patterns that might otherwise remain hidden. In the era of digital humanities, the availability of literary works through initiatives like Project Gutenberg has facilitated new methods of computational text analysis, enabling scholars to examine these patterns across broader datasets with greater accuracy.

Frank Lewis Nason's early 20th-century novel, "Blue Goose," offers an intriguing subject for this type of analysis. As a product of its time, the novel likely incorporates linguistic patterns reflective of Nason's stylistic preferences or the narrative's thematic elements. This study specifically investigates the distribution of the letter 'n'—a frequently used letter in English—within the first thirty lines of each chapter. The guiding research question is whether a significant relationship exists between the frequency of the letter 'n' and the word count in these text segments, and if so, what this relationship may reveal about Nason's approach to writing or the novel's linguistic characteristics.

Leveraging a foundation established by earlier scholars, this paper employs a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to examine the correlation between word count and letter frequency. This approach not only furthers the digital humanities field by applying quantitative methods to literary analysis but also sheds light on the stylistic nuances of Nason's "Blue Goose." Recognizing these patterns enhances our appreciation of Nason's craftsmanship and provides insight into the broader landscape of early 20th-century American literature.

In subsequent sections, we will detail the methods used for data collection and analysis, share our findings, and explore the significance of our research. Through this study, we seek to enrich our understanding of "Blue Goose's" linguistic features, placing it within the larger framework of literary stylistics and computational text analysis.
