# "Exploring Letter Frequency in 'Blue Goose': A Computational Analysis"

## Overview
This project conducts a computational text analysis on Frank Lewis Nason's novel "Blue Goose", focusing on the frequency of the letter 'n' within the first thirty lines of each chapter. Utilizing a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a Poisson distribution, we investigate the relationship between word count and the occurrence of 'n/N's, aiming to uncover any linguistic patterns or stylistic choices made by Nason in his writing.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data/raw_data` contains the raw data as obtained from X.
-   `data/analysis_data` contains the cleaned dataset that was constructed.
-   `other` contains etails about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper.
-   `scripts` conontains R scripts for data processing and analysis

## Statement on LLM usage

The abstract and introduction were written with the help of Chatgpt and the entire chat history is available in inputs/llms/usage.txt.
